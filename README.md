Project_Base
============

This is my basic setup for Web projects built on inuit.css. In no particular order, it includes the following additions:

<ul>
	<li>Simple header layout with basic single-level responsive toggle navigation. Ready to go for very small sites.</li>
	<li>Basic components set up in a css/ui folder to start building on inuit.</li>
	<li>Built-in responsive sticky footer.</li>
</ul>

I use Grunt to do the concatenating/compressing/preprocessing, so my template Gruntfile and package.json are also included. I used Chris Coyier's excellent article <a href="http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/">Grunt for People Who Think Things Like Grunt are Weird and Hard"</a> to get it all set up in the first place. This is just my own setup and I only plan to make changes as they are useful/necessary to me, but you are welcome to use it if you'd like.
